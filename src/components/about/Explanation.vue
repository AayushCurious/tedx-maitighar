          TED is an annual event where some of the world’s leading thinkers and doers are invited to share what they are most passionate about. “TED” stands for Technology, Entertainment, Design — three broad subject areas that are collectively shaping our future. Attendees have called it “the ultimate brain spa” and “a four-day journey into the future.” The diverse audience of CEOs, scientists, creatives, philanthropists is almost as extraordinary as the speakers, such as Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Frank Gehry, Paul Simon, Sir Richard Branson, Philippe Starck and Bono. Today, more than 500 talks from past TED conferences can be viewed online at TED.com. As opposed to the annual TED conferences, TEDx events happen frequently all over the world and are independently organized. These local, self-started events are branded TEDx, where x=independently organized TED event. The TED conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program.
